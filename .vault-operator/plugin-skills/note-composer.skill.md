Plugin "Note Composer" restructures content across notes.

Available commands:
- note-composer:merge-file -- Merge the current note with another note
- note-composer:split-file -- Extract the selected text into a new note
- note-composer:extract-heading -- Extract a heading and its content into a new note

Use this skill when the user wants to reorganize notes: splitting long notes, merging related notes, or extracting sections. These commands operate on the currently open note in the editor.

## Setup Required
