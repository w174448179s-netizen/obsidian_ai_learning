description: Guide for creating effective Vault Operator skills. Use when the user wants to build a new skill (or refine an existing one) that captures a repeatable workflow, a domain expertise, or a tool-integration recipe. Triggers include phrases like "build me a skill", "kannst du das automatisieren", "create a skill", "neuer skill", "make this repeatable".

# Skill Creator

This skill guides the agent through creating a Vault Operator skill that another agent run can pick up and execute reliably. It is the basic authoring flow: initialize, edit, validate.

**If the `skill-creator-pro` skill is available, prefer it for anything beyond a trivial one-step skill.** The Pro flow adds a guided requirements dialog (it interviews the user when they cannot state exactly what they need), a feasibility check against the actual plugin runtime and sandbox limits, a confirmed skill brief before any file is written, and a dry-run. This basic flow stays fully usable on its own; the Pro flow is the upgrade for designing non-trivial skills reliably.

## Binding rules (read first, no exceptions)

1. **The skill folder lives ONLY at `<agent-folder>/data/skills/{skill_name}/`.** Any other path (`Tools & Settings/Skills/`, `Notes/skills/`, vault-root, etc.) is invisible to the discovery layer. A skill written elsewhere does not exist.
2. **`init_skill` is the ONLY way to create the folder.** Do NOT call `create_folder` or `write_file` to seed a new skill manually. Even when you "know" the layout, route through `init_skill` so the validator stays happy and the source-frontmatter is correct.
3. **Existing artifacts at the wrong path are NOT proof the task is done.** If you find a half-finished `weekly-meeting-summary` under `Tools & Settings/Skills/` or similar, treat it as garbage from a previous broken run. Delete it after you have the real skill landed at `data/skills/{name}/`.
4. **`quick_validate` is mandatory before declaring done.** Step 5 is not optional. A skill that "looks right" but was never validated is not finished.
5. **Do not short-circuit by reusing a similar-sounding existing skill.** When the user asks to BUILD a new skill, build a new one. Reuse means edit-and-save under the same name -- different name means new skill, even if the domain overlaps with something that already exists.

## About Vault Operator skills

A Vault Operator skill is a folder under `<agent-folder>/data/skills/{skill_name}/` that contains:

- `SKILL.md` -- the only required file. YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) plus markdown body.
- `scripts/` -- optional JavaScript helpers executable via `run_skill_script`.
- `references/` -- optional markdown files the agent loads on demand.
- `assets/` -- optional binary files the skill emits as output.

The frontmatter `description` is the trigger. The agent picks the skill based on description alone, never reads the body until the skill activates.

## Core principles

### Concise wins

Context window is a shared resource. Only add information the agent does not already have. Every paragraph must justify its tokens. Prefer one concrete example over a paragraph of theory.

### Match freedom to fragility

Pick the right level of detail for each step:

- **High freedom (text instructions)** -- many valid approaches, agent decides.
- **Medium freedom (pseudocode, parametrized scripts)** -- preferred pattern with variation room.
- **Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)** -- fragile or sequence-critical work.

A narrow bridge with cliffs needs guardrails. An open field allows many routes.

### Progressive disclosure

Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. When a section grows past that, move it into a `references/` file and link to it from the body. Reference files load on demand; the body loads on every skill activation.

## Anatomy of a skill folder

```
<agent-folder>/data/skills/{skill_name}/
├── SKILL.md            (required)
├── scripts/            (optional)
│   └── *.js            (executable via run_skill_script)
├── references/         (optional, load on demand via read_file)
│   └── *.md
└── assets/             (optional, copied into output)
    └── *
```

### Frontmatter rules (binding)

Only two fields are written:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: One concise paragraph that explains WHAT the skill does and WHEN to use it. Include explicit triggers so the agent picks it up from the user phrasing.
---
```

Hard constraints enforced by the validator:

- `name` is kebab-case (`[a-z0-9-]+`), max 64 characters, no leading or trailing hyphen, no double hyphens.
- `name` cannot contain the reserved words `anthropic` or `claude`.
- `description` is max 1024 characters, no angle brackets, single line.
- Allowed-only properties: `name`, `description`. Adding extra keys triggers a warning in the discovery layer.

### Anti-patterns

Do NOT create the following in a skill folder:

- `README.md` -- the skill body already tells the agent everything it needs.
- `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` -- meta-noise.
- `tests/` or `examples/` -- the skill is the test surface; put input/output pairs in references/ if needed.
- Wrapper files that just re-export from `references/` -- link directly.

A skill folder only contains files the agent reads at runtime.

## Skill creation workflow

Follow these six steps in order. Skip only when the reason is explicit.

### Step 1: Understand the skill with concrete examples

If usage patterns are unclear, ask the user 1-2 questions at a time:

- "What user requests should trigger this skill?"
- "Give me one concrete example end-to-end of the skill being used."
- "What should the agent return at the end?"

Continue until the functionality is clearly bounded. Avoid asking ten questions at once -- the user drowns.

### Step 2: Plan the reusable contents

For each concrete example, ask:

1. Does this step rewrite the same code each time? -> candidate for `scripts/`
2. Does this step need looked-up schemas or domain knowledge? -> candidate for `references/`
3. Does the output reuse a template? -> candidate for `assets/`

List the planned scripts, references, and assets before initializing.

### Step 3: Initialize the skill folder (MANDATORY before any write)

Call the `init_skill` helper script. This is the only valid way to
seed the folder. It creates the layout under
`<agent-folder>/data/skills/{name}/` with a SKILL.md template (TODO
placeholders) plus empty `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` folders
and stamps `source: user` into the frontmatter.

NEVER substitute manual `write_file` calls for this step. The
discovery layer relies on the `source: user` marker plus the exact
folder location -- bypass either and the skill loads as a stray
artifact (or not at all).

```
run_skill_script({
  skill_name: "skill-creator",
  script_name: "init_skill",
  args: { "name": "my-new-skill" }
})
```

`args.name` is the kebab-case folder name the new skill will get. The
script accepts `args.skill_name` as an alias too if that feels more
natural. Validation errors (kebab-case, reserved words, name conflict)
come back in the tool_result with a clear message. Existing folders
are NOT overwritten -- the script refuses if the target exists.

### Step 4: Edit the skill

Now fill out the SKILL.md body and write the resources you planned.

Writing guidelines:

- Use imperative or infinitive form ("Read the file", not "You should read the file").
- Source code blocks use fenced JavaScript blocks for scripts, fenced text blocks for examples.
- Reference the resources from the SKILL.md body so the agent knows they exist. Resources that are not linked might as well not exist.

When writing `scripts/*.js`:

- Export `async function execute(args, ctx)`. Both parameters are positional: `args` is the JSON-serializable args dict from `run_skill_script`, `ctx` is the sandbox bridge with `ctx.vault.read/write/list/readBinary/writeBinary` and `ctx.requestUrl`. The return value is JSON-serialized into the tool_result.
- The bare global `ctx` is NOT available -- declare it as the second parameter of execute.
- No `require`, no `fetch`, no DOM, no Node Buffer. Use `TextEncoder` for string-to-bytes.
- Time out at 30 seconds. Heap cap 128 MB. See `sandbox-environment` skill for details.

When writing `references/*.md`:

- One topic per file. The agent reads it via `read_file` on demand.
- Keep individual files under 200 lines. For longer files, include a table of contents at the top.

### Step 5: Validate

Run the `quick_validate` helper. It checks frontmatter shape and allowed-only properties.

```
run_skill_script({
  skill_name: "skill-creator",
  script_name: "quick_validate",
  args: { "name": "my-skill" }
})
```

Returns `{ valid: boolean, errors: string[], warnings: string[] }`. Fix any errors before declaring the skill done. Warnings (TODO placeholder still in description, unexpected frontmatter keys, anti-pattern files) do not block but should be cleaned up.

### Step 6: Iterate

Use the skill on a real task. Notice friction. Update SKILL.md or resources. Re-validate. Repeat.

After two-three real uses the rough edges usually surface. Refactor then, not before.

## Patterns library

For deeper guidance on body structure and output format, the agent loads these on demand:

- `references/workflows.md` -- sequential and conditional workflow patterns.
- `references/output-patterns.md` -- template and example patterns for consistent output.
- `references/composability.md` -- invoke_skill / invoke_mcp_server: how to call other skills or MCP-server tools as building blocks from inside a skill body.

Link these from the new skill's SKILL.md only when the new skill itself follows the pattern.

## Where the skill lands

Skills created via this workflow land in `<agent-folder>/data/skills/{name}/` with `source: agent` written to frontmatter by `init_skill`. The agent never writes into `builtin/` (Sebastian-managed) or under a plugin-id source (VaultDNA-managed) -- the validator rejects that.

The Source column in Settings -> Skills distinguishes three categories:

- **Built-in**: ships with the plugin (materialized from `bundled-skills/`).
- **Agent**: created via this skill-creator workflow (quality-gated by `init_skill` + `quick_validate`).
- **User**: manually written, copied, or imported by the user (no quality gate).

If a skill-creator-authored skill conflicts with a builtin or plugin skill of the same name, the agent version wins on every plugin reload (the materializer skips overwrite).
